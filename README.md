## **About**
The Live preview web socket server as an IntelliJ plugin to use alongside [**Beagle**](https://github.com/ZupIT/beagle).

## **Usage**

### **Requirements**

Check out the requirements before using the plugin:

1. For plugin versions 1.0.0 to 1.0.2:
- **JDK 8+**

2. For plugin version 1.1.0:

- **JDK 11+**

>Due to the IntelliJ support for the 2020.3 update in the Live Preview plugin, IntelliJ has support for new versions of the IDE IntelliJ idea for JDK from 11 or higher. For more information, check out the [**IntelliJ blog post explaining the reason for migrating to JDK 11**](https://blog.jetbrains.com/platform/2020/09/intellij-project-migrates-to-java-11/). This is the reason for the requirement of version 1.1.0 of the Live Preview plugin.

### **Developer Certificate of Origin - DCO**

 This is a security layer for the project and for the developers. It is mandatory.
 
 Follow one of these two methods to add DCO to your commits:
 
**1. Command line**
 Follow the steps: 
 **Step 1:** Configure your local git environment adding the same name and e-mail configured at your GitHub account. It helps to sign commits manually during reviews and suggestions.

 ```
git config --global user.name “Name”
git config --global user.email “email@domain.com.br”
```

**Step 2:** Add the Signed-off-by line with the `'-s'` flag in the git commit command:

```
$ git commit -s -m "This is my commit message"
```

**2. GitHub website**
You can also manually sign your commits during GitHub reviews and suggestions, follow the steps below: 

**Step 1:** When the commit changes box opens, manually type or paste your signature in the comment box, see the example:

```
Signed-off-by: Name < e-mail address >
```

For this method, your name and e-mail must be the same registered on your GitHub account.
